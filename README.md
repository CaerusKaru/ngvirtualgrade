# NG-Virtualgrade

A front-end grade report/grading/course administration web portal written for Angular 2.0+, using Angular Material and Covalent.

Meant to be used with the pyvirtualgrade backend module (written in Flask).

Contains functionality for three types of user:

- Student: consumes grade reports from courses
- Grader: consumes raw submissions and adds annotations for grade report
- Archon (admin): creates and manages all course-related details (type of assignment, due date, rubric, etc)
